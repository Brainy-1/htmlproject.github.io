<p>Several well known mathematicians have written autobiographies in part to explain to a general audience what it is about mathematics that has made them want to devote their lives to its study. These provide some of the best glimpses into what it means to be a mathematician. The following list contains some works that are not autobiographies, but rather essays on mathematics and mathematicians with strong autobiographical elements.</p>

(i)The Book of My Life â€“ Girolamo Cardano
(ii)A Mathematician's Apology - G.H. Hardy
(iii)A Mathematician's Miscellany (republished as Littlewood's miscellany) - J. E. Littlewood
